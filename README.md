# Beginners C Program Examples

Compared to [upstream repository](https://github.com/gouravthakur39/beginners-C-program-examples) , many source files are revised. Please help me to improve the codes if you want. 

## Reference site
One of the C reference sites that I trust is [this one](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c).


##  Book
There are several recommended books on C. First one is called [K&R](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/).

## Linux compile
### gcc
```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -lm -std=c11 file_name.c
```
### executing in the same directory
```
./a.out
```
## Windows compile
Free and capable compilers are [LLVM Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) and [mingw](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/).

## IDE
There are many IDEs available. [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) is free , open source , multi platform. You may search for more and choose what suits you.
